## Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

Wanted to refresh knowledge about the Algorithms basics since I didn't have an opportutiny to do it well during the studies.

## Content description <a name="content"></a>

The plan is to put make all chapters from this book in one C++ project.

## Licensing, Authors, and Acknowledgements <a name="licensing"></a>

I'm reinterpreting the code from the book [Introduction to Algorithms 3rd edition](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-third-edition), by:
* Thomas H. Cormen
* Charles E. Leiserson
* Ronald L. Rivest
* Clifford Stein

and whole consent should go to Them. 

I'm just reading their book and re-writing some code that I find good to write as a form of excercise.
