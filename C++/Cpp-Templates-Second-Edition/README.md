## Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

Started working on it as [C++ Templates](https://www.amazon.com/C-Templates-Complete-Guide-2nd/dp/0321714121) book was standing so sad on my bookshelf, unfinished. Though it may be good to cheer it up.

Going to present here to some C++ template aspects implemented in my own way a bit, structured as my mind will dictate. Also I would like to practice and learn new things about C++ templates with this code.

## Content description <a name="content"></a>

The plan is to put make all chapters from this book as a separate C++ projects, where some template aspects will be presented. How many of them and in which way? I have no idea, time will tell.

## Licensing, Authors, and Acknowledgements <a name="licensing"></a>

I'm reinterpreting the code from the book [C++ Templates The Complete Guide - Second Edition](https://www.amazon.com/C-Templates-Complete-Guide-2nd/dp/0321714121), by:
* David Vandervoorde
* Nicolai M. Josuttis
* Douglas Gregor 

and whole consent should go to Them. 

I'm just reading their book and re-writing some code that I find good to write as a form of excercise.
