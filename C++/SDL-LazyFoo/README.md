# SDL by Lazy Foo

This is a tutorial project to learn about the SDL library. The work is done based on the tutorial from [LazyFoo](https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/index.php).

## Licensing

I'm using here the SDL library in version 2.0.20, the reason why it's here put some cmake configuration file is that on Windows I need to create such file to be able to compile it with cmake. It's used directly so I will remember about this Windows specific trick.
