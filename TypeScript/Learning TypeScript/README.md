## Learning TypeScript

Based on book "Learning TypeScript" by Josh Goldberg.

## Installation

To install typescript globally just:
```
npm i -g typescript
```

This will give you the compiler for TypeScript (`tsc`).

To initalize the compiler in the directory type: `tsc --init`.

Then you can compile by: `tsc <filename>` - this will compile the code to pure JavaScript.

To run particular script: `node <filename>`.
