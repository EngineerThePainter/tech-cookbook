This is the list of my different things that I did with STM32 course by Forbot: "STM32L4 for beginners by Piotr Bugalski and Damian Szyma≈Ñski".

I did some differences in order to learn as much as possible:
* Using VSCode and Make to build it - CubeIDE is nice, but I wanted to be more closer to metal (and I do not like when someone is telling me where I can or where I cannot write code).
* Using opencm3 instead of HAL.
