## Description

The work presented here is taken from the 
[PyTorch Lightning Masterclass](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaMu-SDt_RB5NUm67hU2pdE75j6KaIOv2).

The code from the course is a bit messy due to live coding, so here I'm presenting 
a refined version of it. Please check these yt classes if you have a knowledge in Deep Learning and you want to
learn some good library for implementation purposes.
