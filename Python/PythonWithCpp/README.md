## Description <a name="description"></a>

The goal of this small project is showing how to use C/C++ code from the Python side. Current scope is to present how it's done using built-in Python ctypes package aiming directly to C language and Pybind11 that aims for wrapping C++ since C++11.

## Files <a name="files"></a>

* Ctypes - show how to wrap C-code into Python language using built-in `ctypes` Python package and the `invoke` package.

* PyBind - show wrapping >C++11 code into Python using PyBind11 library.
